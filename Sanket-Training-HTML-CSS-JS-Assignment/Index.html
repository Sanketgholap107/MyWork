              In order to write, one must read constantly, observe the world
              well, and take seriously the craft of writing. During this five
              week course, we will focus on the last of these, the craft of
              writing specifically, we will focus on three mainstays of fiction:
              character, dialogue, and scene.
            </p>

            <p>
              “I think that writers often feel more comfortable writing
              exposition and summary than scene, perhaps because in our own
              lives we often feel more comfortable observing than engaging, and
              scene is about getting our characters to engage, says instructor
              Lori Ostlund. “In this class we will focus on creating scenes as a
              way to develop characters, demonstrate changes in them, and
              increase tension.
            </p>

            <p>
              “We will also spend a lot of time on dialogue, thinking about it
              as a way to reveal character and relationships and, perhaps most
              important, as a way to reveal the shifting power dynamics that are
              at work in those relationships and which create tension.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will look at examples from short stories and novels and engage
              in in class exercises that focus on these three craft building
              blocks. Participants will use these exercises to create work at
              home, which we will workshop during the last two weeks of class.
              “My goal, Lori says, is for us to think about these craft elements
              in ways that are new and generative.
